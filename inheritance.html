    <h1>Dancing Plague of 1518</h1>
    <h4>The dancing plague of 1518, or dance epidemic of 1518 (French: Épidémie dansante de 1518), was a case of dancing mania that occurred in Strasbourg, Alsace (modern-day France), in the Holy Roman Empire from July 1518 to September 1518. Somewhere between 50 and 400 people took to dancing for weeks. There are many theories behind the phenomenon, the most popular being stress-induced mass hysteria, suggested by John Waller. Other theories include ergot and religious explanations. There is controversy concerning the number of deaths.</h4>

    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>The outbreak began in July 1518 when a woman called Frau Troffea began to dance fervently and uncontrollably in a street in Strasbourg.</p>
    
    <p>Troffea kept up the constant dancing for a week. Soon, three dozen others joined in.By August, the "dancing plague" had claimed 400 victims.Dancers were beginning to collapse. It is said some even died from a stroke or heart attack.No one knew what caused this reaction, which meant no one understood how to remedy it. By early September, the outbreak began to subside, when the dancers were sent to a mountain shrine to pray for absolution.</p>
